# Comprehensive-Banking-Analytics

**Project Overview**
The Comprehensive Banking Analytics project aims to leverage advanced data analytics techniques to extract valuable insights and enhance decision-making processes within the banking sector. The project addresses key components including customer segmentation, credit risk assessment, and performance prediction using clustering, classification, and regression models.

**Project Various Steps:**
**Data Exploration**
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.

**Data visualization:**
Ploted colleration matrix to get insights about dependend and independed variables. Made chats like( Bocxplot,countplot,distplot,pairplot).

**Model Selection:**
K-Means+ clustering algorithm is used for creating segments and Made many classifiers models like Logistic Regression,RandomForestClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier,LGBM classifier but selected LIGHT GBM Classifier.

**Hyperparameter Optimization:**
Using Randomizedsearch CV and GridSearch CV to select the best parameter for training the model

**Model Dump:**
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development

**Framework:**
App is created on STREAMLIT framework

**Model Accuracy:**
98%
**Conclusion**
Creating a segmentation of customers based on their bank details and divide them into some groups through clustering algorithms and then making a prediction on those groups for new customers.
Visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.
A comprehensive report summarizing findings, model performances, and recommendations for the banking institution.
